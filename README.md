# Tip-Calculator
A calculator that determines the total money you need to bring to buy something from a restaurant with tax and tip included. 

# Purpose: 

  Alot of people go to restaurants to buy food but then looking at all the options and the amount of money they have, causes them to sometimes overspend and go over budget and they realize it when its too late, or sometimes people underestimate the cost and dont bring enough money. 
	
  I made this calculator from Python 3 that asks the person for the cost of the dishes and amount of tip the  person is planning to give and then using that info and the tax rate for ontario residents. The calculator spits out a total, which is the exact total amount of money you need to bring to be able to afford what your planning to get. 
	
  This prevents the customer from buying more uneccasry things or over spending as well as prevents the customer from bringing to little because now they have a muinimum amount they know that they should bring. 

# How it works
1. Its not to complicated but the program asks for the total price of the food which can be found on the menue or website. 
2. The progam then asks for how much tip your planning to give in percentage
3. The program does a series of calculations that calculates the total cost of the food including the tax, by first calculating how much tax your actually giving and adding that to the total cost of the food
4. 13% Tax is added to the total and then the total is printed out displaying how much money you need to be able to get what you want including tax and tip. (The 13% tax is applied because the tax rate in ontario is 13% but this code can be used anywhere but just remember to change the tax value to whatever the tax rate is in your area
