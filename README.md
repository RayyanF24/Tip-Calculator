# Tip-Calculator
A calculator that determines the total money you need to bring to buy something from a restaurant with tax and tip included. 
Purpose: 
  Alot of people go to restaurants to buy food but then looking at all the options and the amount of money they have, causes them to sometimes overspend and go over budget and they realize it when its too late, or sometimes people underestimate the cost and dont bring enough money. 
  I made this calculator from Python 3 that asks the person for the cost of the dishes and amount of tip the  person is planning to give and then using that info and the tax rate for ontario residents. The calculator spits out a total, which is the exact total amount of money you need to bring to be able to afford what your planning to get. 
  This prevents the customer from buying more uneccasry things or over spending as well as prevents the customer from bringing to little because now they have a muinimum amount they know that they should bring.
